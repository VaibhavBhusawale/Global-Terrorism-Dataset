# Global-Terrorism-Dataset
Exploratory data Analysis of GTD 1970 to 2017 
I recently completed my first EDA Capstone project as part of Data Science Cource at AlmaBetter.
For this project , I analyzed Global Terrorism Dataset of 1970 to 2017 which contains international and National
terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks.

As the first step, perform Data wrangling over the raw data of terrorism (1960 to 2017) further I divided my solution into Three main parts i.e. World Wide terrorism, Terrorism in India and the last work on Tableau to form Dashboard.
In World Terrorism I focused on the firstly importing required Libraries and cleaning the data set then working on some basic analysis like Highest Terrorism Attacks in Various Countries and Region wise. After that Analysis found out the Top terrorist Country and region.
Next step is plottingthe related Graphs which can show the terrorist activity.Howit has increased year wise. And which is the most affected country in the region. By using Bar graph, I found out the top most active Terrorism Group in the world.
The second part of my solution is finding out the total Activity observed in Indian Territory i.e. plotting the graphs related to highest terror attacks in states ,Top most Terrorism group, evaluating the which state has maximum casualties. Which terrorist groups are involved in these casualties and the ammunition and way of attacks used by them.
In the last step for my solution I used Tableau which can help me to show graphical representation which can help us tounderstand that how the terrorism has spread worldwide. That's all! We reached the end of our exercise. Starting with loading the data so far we have done EDA, null values treatment, encoding of categorical columns, feature selection and then model building and exploring the useful data. And hopefully this data will help us how to control and minimize the terrorism attack on most sensitive part of the different region.
